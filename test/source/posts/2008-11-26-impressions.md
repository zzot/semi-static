Once I really started trying to catch up, it look less than a day.  Here are
a few observations I made along the way:

* Progressive lack of sleep[^setup] combined with jetlag does not seem to help
  this process.  The day that it took me only a small part of was Monday.
* I've got quite a few feeds that can be disposed of quickly for various reasons:
  * A couple of them are (I assume) broken, because most or all of the feed pops
    up as unread whenever a new item is added or (sometimes) just because it
    feels like it.
  * For some sources, I have to subscribe to multiple, overlapping feeds to get
    all the stuff I'm interested in.[^wired]
  * Some have such a low S/N ratio that I either don't bother with them and hit
    _Mark All as Read_[^mailorder] or I tend to skim the item titles a page at
    a time looking for stuff I care about rather than spacing through everything.[^vt]
* Unsurprisingly, you notice how much material is repeated feed after feed far
  more when you're reading most of a week's items rather than a couple of hours
  worth.

At any rate, I'm back to my old daily process of asking myself why I'm subscribed
to so many feeds that are full of crap.
