I sort of “went dark” this week. I was in Los Angeles for a few exhibits we
worked on for the [LA Auto Show][la]. We flew out Monday and returned Friday.
At some point on Tuesday, I was definitely caught up in
[NetNewsWire for iPhone][nnw]. By Friday morning it had been at least a couple
of days.

Today, I started with over 3,700 items to read.

Here are my options on how to deal with this:

1. Spend an unspecified number of days doing nothing but reading “news”. [^news]
2. [RSS Bankruptcy][rssb]. While we've all heard of the [email][emailb] variety,
   I figured someone, somewhere had already filed under _Chapter RSS_ — I was right.
3. Unsubscribed from a lot of feeds, combined with #1 or #2.

You could certainly argue that gathering that many items in a few days clearly
indicates #3 be applied immediately,[^agree] I'm starting out with #1
interleaved with the rest of my life because its the least destructive.
More to come.

[^news]: Some of it certainly qualifies as news.  A lot of it doesn't.
[^agree]: …and I'd be somewhat inclined to agree
