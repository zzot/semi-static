= semi-static

* http://github.com/zzot/semi-static

== DESCRIPTION:

When I first saw Jekyll (http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) I latched onto it,
but I soon found a few things that (understandably) didn't quite match how I
wanted them to work.  Rather forking Jekyll and trying to turn it into
something totally different, I created my own version that works how I want
it to.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Uses Haml instead of Liquid for layouts.
* Processes Sass stylesheets into CSS.
* Probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.

== SYNOPSIS:

  semi <source path>

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Haml
* Maruku

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install zzot-semi-static
